This project uses orbit predictor to send tweet when a sattelite approaches above you.

The TLEs come from celestrak website - http://celestrak.com/NORAD/elements/active.txt

An intresting visualtization project is here

This guys has tried to do something simmilar like a ground station

Full fledged Ground station

C++ Algorithms implemented form the book 
http://www.naughter.com/aa.html - Astronomical Algorithms" by Jean Meeus - If needed we can convert any of these into javascript with transpiler.

### For groundtrack visualiisation
https://observablehq.com/@jake-low/satellite-ground-track-visualizer - uses threejs
https://github.com/StevenSamirMichael/astrokit - examples directory  

Use this for groundtrack and 3d visualisation
